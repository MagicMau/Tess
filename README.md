Tess
====

An extension to Minecraft's Citizens API (a "trait") inspired by Denizen to code NPCs in JavaScript. Because I wanted to write my code in TypeScript rather than DenizenScript, I started this voyage. Hence the name: TypeScript -> TS -> Tess. Functionality and ideas heavily borrowed from Denizen (aufdemrand and others). Without their code this wouldn't have been possible for me.
