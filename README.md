Tess
====

An extension to Minecraft's Citizens API (a "trait") inspired by Denizen to code NPCs in JavaScript.
Because I wanted to write my code in TypeScript rather than DenizenScript, I started this voyage.
Hence the name: TypeScript -> TS -> Tess. Functionality and ideas heavily borrowed from Denizen (aufdemrand and others).
Without their code this wouldn't have been possible for me.

Feel free to fork, modify and update this as you wish. Would be nice if you added something nice you submit a pull request,
but totally up to you.

By the way, I'm relying on Java 8 in this project, so be sure to point to the right JDK.

Also please make sure that you're using the latest development builds of both CraftBukkit and the Citizens plugin.
